# CS-370_Current-Emerging-Trends
This project we were given most of the structure of the code we were tasked with creating an algorithm.  I took time to research the problem and the different aspects of the algorithm that would be needed.  I then ran the project to see how it went, as its rand I tried to optimize it by adding epsilon decay.
Computer scientists are problem solvers, as a computer scientist our job is to solve problems with code.  Computer scientists take theory and put it into practice as an engineer, designing software and then testing and modifying it to make it better.


When I approach problems as a computer scientist, I try to break the problem down into all its components. From there I then try to solve each problem one at a time trying to find the solution.  After I think I have found the correct solution I then test over several iterations. I then try to keep my project from the past in case I can parts of them again.


It is my responsibility as a computer scientist to protect end users’ data.  I also need to ensure that the algorithms I develop are free from bias as much as possible.  I must also try to make my software accessible and useable by as many people as possible. I also must maintain transparency about the capabilities and the limitations of my software.
